    == DESCRIPTION:
    
    RVM is the Ruby enVironment Manager (rvm).
    
    It manages Ruby application environments and enables switching between them.
    
    == Installation
    
      curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --autolibs=enabled [--ruby] [--rails] [--trace]
    
    stable     :: Install stable RVM, good for servers.
    --ruby     :: Additionally install latest ruby version (MRI).
    --rails    :: Install gem rails into default gemset (also installs ruby=).
    --trace    :: Print trace of the installation, gist output when you have problems.
    --autolibs :: Enable or disable autolibs see: https://rvm.io/rvm/autolibs
    
    More details here: https://rvm.io/rvm/install/
    
    == Usage
    
      rvm [Flags] [Options] Action [Implementation[,Implementation[,...]]
    
    == Flags
    
    --default         :: with 'rvm use X', sets the default ruby for new shells to X.
    --debug           :: Toggle debug mode on for very verbose output.
    --disable-binary  :: Install from source instead of using binaries
    --trace           :: Toggle trace mode on to see EVERYTHING rvm is doing.
    --force           :: Force install, removes old install & source before install.
    --summary         :: Used with rubydo to print out a summary of the commands run.
    --latest          :: with gemset --dump skips version strings for latest gem.
    --gems            :: with uninstall/remove removes gems with the interpreter.
    --docs            :: with install, attempt to generate ri after installation.
    --reconfigure     :: Force ./configure on install even if Makefile already exists.
    --skip-gemsets    :: with install, skip the installation of default gemsets.
    --quiet-curl      :: Makes curl silent when fetching data
    
    == Options
    
    -v|--version     :: Emit rvm version loaded for current shell
    -l|--level       :: patch level to use with rvm use / install
       --bin         :: path for binaries to be placed (~/.rvm/bin/)
    -S               :: Specify a script file to attempt to load and run (rubydo)
    -e               :: Execute code from the command line.
    --gems           :: Used to set the 'gems_flag', use with 'remove' to remove
                        gems
    --archive        :: Used to set the 'archive_flag', use with 'remove' to remove
                        archive
    --patch          :: With MRI Rubies you may specify one or more full paths to
                        patches
    
                        for multiple, specify comma separated:
    
                          --patch /.../.../a.patch[%prefix],/.../.../.../b.patch
    
                        'prefix' is an optional argument, which will be bypassed
                        to the '-p' argument of the 'patch' command. It is separated
                        from patch file name with '%' symbol.
    -C|--configure   :: custom configure options. If you need to pass several
                        configure options then append them comma separated:
    
                          -C --...,--...,--...
    
    --nice           :: process niceness (for slow computers, default 0)
    --ree-options    :: Options passed directly to ree's './installer' on the
                        command line.
    --with-rubies    :: Specifies a string for rvm to attempt to expand for set
                        operations.
    
    == Action
    
    (Note: for most actions, 'rvm help action-name' may provide more information.)
    
    *usage*     :: show this usage information
    version     :: show the rvm version installed in rvm_path
    use         :: setup current shell to use a specific ruby version
    reload      :: reload rvm source itself (useful after changing rvm source)
    implode     :: (seppuku) removes the rvm installation completely.
    
                   This means everything in $rvm_path (~/.rvm || /usr/local/rvm).
    
                   This does not touch your profiles. However, this means that you
                   must manually clean up your profiles and remove the lines which
                   source RVM.
    get         :: {head,stable} upgrades rvm to latest head or stable version.
    
                   Check 'rvm help get' for more details.
    
                   (If you experience bugs try this first with head version, then
                   ask for help in #rvm on irc.freenode.net and hang around)
    reset       :: remove current and stored default & system settings.
    
                   (If you experience odd behavior try this second)
    info        :: show the *current* environment information for current ruby
    current     :: print the *current* ruby version and the name of any gemset
                   being used.
    debug       :: show info plus additional information for common issues
    
    install     :: install one or many ruby versions
    
                   See also: https://rvm.io/rubies/installing/
    uninstall   :: uninstall one or many ruby versions, leaves their sources
    remove      :: uninstall one or many ruby versions and remove their sources

                   miscellaneous data associated with rvm.

	Description:
	    The 'rails new' command creates a new Rails application with a default
	    directory structure and configuration at the path you specify.
	
	    You can specify extra command-line arguments to be used every time
	    'rails new' runs in the .railsrc configuration file in your home directory.
	
	    Note that the arguments specified in the .railsrc file don't affect the
	    defaults values shown above in this help message.
	
	Example:
	    rails new ~/Code/Ruby/weblog
	
	    This generates a skeletal Rails installation in ~/Code/Ruby/weblog.
	    See the README in the newly created application to get going.
